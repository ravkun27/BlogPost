       Tailwind CSS is a popular and <span class="italic font-bold text-blue-700">powerful CSS
       framework </span>that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes
       that can be used to quickly and easily style HTML elements. The
       framework is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers

        One of the key benefits of Tailwind CSS is that it promotes
        consistency in design by providing a set of pre-defined classes that
        can be used across an entire website or application. This helps to
        ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it
        <span class="font-bold"> easier to maintain and update the design over time.</span>

     <p class="mb-4">
       Examples of such utility classes includes the
       <span class="font-bold">"text-center"</span> class can be used to center align text,
       while the <span class="font-bold">"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to add a light
       gray background color to an element.
